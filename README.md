Welcome to the code for WDCNZ.

it should be relatively simple to get started. 

* install node and npm
* install grunt (npm install grunt-cli -g)
* run grunt serve
* hack away

Pull requests should pass any linting tests, and should run via grunt serve.

Pull requests will be accepted for any usability issues, browser issues or things that just don't work. Not so much for content unless it's in that spectrum.
